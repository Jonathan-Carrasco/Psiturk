# GoldStone and Carvalho Online Replication Experiment

The aim of this project was to replicate the findings of GoldStone and Carvalho's 2015 experiment which highlighted the benefits of interleaved and blocked study. Through python's Psiturk package I was able to post online experiments to Amazon Turk workers and automate features like counterbalancing, bonusing workers for impressive results, preventing workers from completing the same experiment more than once, and others.
